= How to use an API endpoint

== Available API endpoints

Running the https://github.com/vaadin/base-starter-connect[`base-starter-connect`] project with `npm install && npm start` will also include an API browser server at http://localhost:8082. You can check it out and see all the available API endpoints which are exposed from `@VaadinService` Java classes.

In addition, the API browser also shows all the documentation of your services and API endpoints based on the Javadocs from your service classes.

== Generate ES modules from your Java services [[generate-ts-wrappers]]

To easily use the API endpoints in JavaScript, the <<vaadin-connect-maven-plugin#, `vaadin-connect-maven-plugin`>> helps you to generate all the necessary files. All the plugin's goals are attached to the `compile` phase of https://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-the-lifecycle.html[Maven lifecycle]. So whenever you run `mvn compile`, the plugin will generate all the needed files for you. By default, `npm start` also triggers the `mvn compile`, therefore everything should be ready when running the application with `npm start`.

For example, the generated ES module for the Java service defined in <<how-to-add-api-endpoint#CounterService.java,CounterService.java>> would looks like:

.CounterService.ts
[source,typescript]
[[CounterService.ts]]
----
/**
 * A Vaadin Connect service that counts numbers.
 *
 * This module has been generated from CounterService.java
 * @module CounterService
 */

import client from './connect-client.default.ts';

/**
 * A method that adds one to the argument.
 *
 * @param number
 */
export function addOne(number: number): Promise<number> {
  return client.call('CounterService', 'addOne', {number}, {requireCredentials: true});
}
----

By default, the generated files are located under `${project.dir}/frontend/generated`. You can change the folder by <<vaadin-connect-maven-plugin#generatedFrontendDirectory,providing the path for the generator>>.

[NOTE]
====
The plugin also re-generates all the files whenever you make changes to your Java files.
====

== Import and use generated TypeScript modules

All the methods in the generated modules are exported so you can either import them separately or the whole module as a service. For instance, the <<CounterService.ts>> could be used as the following snippets:

.index.ts (import the whole module)
[[index.ts]]
[source,typescript]
----
// Other imports
import * as counterService from './generated/CounterService.ts';

// Other code
counterService.addOne(1).then(result => console.log(result));
----

.index.ts (only import the needed method)
[source,typescript]
----
// Other imports
import {addOne} from './generated/CounterService.ts';

// Other code
addOne(1).then(result => console.log(result));
----

== How is the security taken into account?

With the snippet in <<index.ts>>, your application might not work as you expected because all the API endpoints are secured by default. You will need to authenticate before you can call the API endpoint. See <<security#, Vaadin Connect security>> for information about authentication, authorization and example how to create <<how-to-add-login-form#,a login form>>.

== Code-completion for JavaScript

As you see in <<CounterService.ts>>, the Javadoc of `@VaadinService` class is preserved the generated TypeScript file, as well as the type definitions are maintained. This helps code-completion work pretty well in *Visual Studio Code* and *Intellij IDEA Ultimate Edition*.
