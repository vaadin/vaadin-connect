= Security in Vaadin Connect

== Authentication flow


*_Vaadin Connect Authentication flow_* meets a simplified specification of the *_OAuth 2.0_* known as the *_Password Grant flow_*, which is explained in the <<appendix,appendix>>.

In Vaadin Connect, the `_client application_` that consumes services, is the front-end JavaScript running in the user's browser, whereas the Java server acts as both: the `_resource server_` exposing services, and the `_authorization server_` verifying user's credentials.

The *_Vaadin Connect authentication flow_* is originated in the browser, when the JavaScript application accesses a service for the first time. The user's browser sends an authentication request with the password credentials, then the server validates those and emits an `_access token_` that the  JavaScript application will use in successive service requests.

Besides the `_access token_`, the server returns a `_refresh token_` that will be used to get a new `_access token_` when the previous one expires.

== Implementation

The Vaadin Connect Java runtime comes with a built-in auth endpoint that by default makes it easy to configure authentication for the exposed services. It includes everything needed for the *authentication* providing easy mechanisms to validate credentials and tokens, and for the *authorization* of which roles can access certain services.

In addition, the Vaadin Connect front-end API covers the flow whether to ask for the `user/password` pair, or use the `refresh token` when consuming Vaadin Connect services. Also, it automatically adds headers with the `access token` to each request made to consume services.

Therefore the developer only have to worry on implementing a way to ask for user password. The client API as well provides methods to login and logout 

Since Vaadin Connect is implemented on top of Spring, the OAuth part relies on https://spring.io/projects/spring-security-oauth[Spring Security OAuth], though Vaadin Connect simplifies the process by providing the `@EnableVaadinConnectOAuthServer` annotation which configures everything, except the users repository that must be provided by the developer via the `UserDetailsService` Bean.

[NOTE]
====
By default, Vaadin Connect uses BCrypted passwords, but you can override it by providing your own `PasswordEncoder` Bean.
====

== Client Configuration

You need provide a credentials function to the `client` instance.
The function can either, return an object with the `username`, `password` and `stayLoggedIn` properties, or a `Promise` that will resolve when the user asynchronously introduces those values in a UI form. It receives as parameter an `options` object. If `options.message` is set, it means that credentials are asked again and contains the server error description from last authentication response.

=== Synchronous example

This demo shows how automatically login to the app with hardcoded credentials when the user requests a service.

[source,javascript]
----
import client from './generated/connect-client.default.js';
client.credentials = (options = {}) => {
  return {username: 'test_login', password: 'test_password', stayLoggedIn: true};
};
----

=== Login form example

This examples demonstrates a login form to asynchronously ask for user credentials.

[source,html]
----
Username: <input id="name">
Username: <input id="password"type="password">
<button id="login">Login</button>
<button id="logout">Logout</button>
----


[source,javascript]
----
import client from './generated/connect-client.default.js';

const username = document.getElementById('username');
const password = document.getElementById('password');
const login = document.getElementById('login');
const logout = document.getElementById('logout');

client.credentials = (options = {}) => {
  return new Promise(resolve => {
    login.addEventListener('click', e => {
      resolve({username: username.value, password: password.value, stayLoggedIn: true};
    }, {once: true});
  });
};

logout.addEventListener('click', e => client.logout());

client.login();
----

== Server Configuration

=== Authentication

In order to enable built-int authentication, you need to mark your application with the `@EnableVaadinConnectOAuthServer` annotation, and provide a valid `UserDetailsService`.

==== Harcoded User Account example

The following example defines just one valid user for the entire application.

Take in account that the password must be bcrypt-ed in order to be compatible with the default encoder provided in Vaadin Connect.

[source,java]
----
@EnableVaadinConnectOAuthServer
public class MyDemoApplication {

  private UserDetails myUser = User.builder()
    .username("daffy") // password is duck
    .password("$2a$04$zm9sHQ5ELrUglsbZTj3DFuP9osJKURNHCWq59e2x1eRlwWLQSWMZi")
    .roles("USER").build();

  @Bean
  public UserDetailsService userDetailsService() {
      return username ->
          username.equals(myUser.getUsername()) ? myUser : null;
  }

  ...
}
----

==== JPA User repository example

The next example uses Spring Data Repositories with JPA for the persistent database with the user accounts.

Notice that the default encoder is called to bcrypt passwords before storing them in the database.

[source,java]
----
@EnableVaadinConnectOAuthServer
public class MyDemoApplication {
  @Bean
  public UserDetailsService userDetailsService(AccountRepository accountRepository) {
    return username -> accountRepository
        .findByUsername(username)
        .map(account -> User.builder()
            .username(account.getUsername())
            .password(account.getPassword())
            .roles("USER").build())
        .orElseThrow(() -> new UsernameNotFoundException(username));
  }

  @Bean
  CommandLineRunner init(AccountRepository accountRepository, PasswordEncoder encoder) {
    accountRepository.save(new UserAccount(
      "daffy",
      encoder.encode("duck")));
  };

  ...
}

/** The JPA User Accounts Repository */
public interface AccountRepository extends JpaRepository<UserAccount, Long> {
  Optional<UserAccount> findByUsername(String username);
}

/** The JPA User Account Entity */
@Entity
public class UserAccount {
  @Id @GeneratedValue private Long id;
  @NotEmpty private String username;
  @JsonIgnore private String password;

  public UserAccount() {
  }
  public UserAccount(String username, String password) {
    this.username = username;
    this.password = password;
  }

  public Long getId() {
    return id;
  }
  public String getUsername() {
    return username;
  }
  public String getPassword() {
    return password;
  }
}
----

==== LDAP repository example

Finally you could configure Vaadin Connect to use a custom authentication mechanism by providing a personalized `AuthenticationManager` Bean.

In this example, an LDAP directory is used to retrieve user accounts.

[source,java]
----
@EnableVaadinConnectOAuthServer
public class MyDemoApplication {

  @Bean
  AuthenticationManager authenticationManager(
    ObjectPostProcessor<Object> objectPostProcessor) throws Exception {

    AuthenticationManagerBuilder builder =
      new AuthenticationManagerBuilder(objectPostProcessor);

    builder
      .ldapAuthentication()
        .userDnPatterns("uid={0},ou=people")
        .groupSearchBase("ou=groups")
        .contextSource()
        .url("ldap://localhost:8389/dc=example,dc=com")
        .and()
      .passwordCompare()
        .passwordAttribute("userPassword");

    return builder.getObject();
  }
  ...
}
----

=== Authorization

Vaadin Connect provides access control (aka ACL) to service classes via the following annotations:

- `@PermitAll`: grants access to any authenticated user
- `@RolesAllowed`: grants access to users having the specified roles
- `@DenyAll`: deny access to all users
- `@AnonymousAllowed`: grants anonymous access

The rules of thumb are that: when no annotation is given `permitAll` applies, _method-level_ has preference over _class-level_ annotations, and the most restrictive rule wins.

So, `DenyAll` overrides `AnonymousAllowed`, and `AnonymousAllowed` overrides `PermitAll` and `RolesAllowed`.

==== Method-level Examples

[source,java]
----
@VaadinService
public class MyService {

  public void notAnnotatedService() {
    // Permited to all authenticated users
  }

  @PermitAll
  public void permittedToAllService() {
    // Permited to all authenticated users
  }

  @AnonymousAllowed
  public void anonymousService() {
    // Permitted to all (authenticated & anonymous) users
  }

  @PermitAll @AnonymousAllowed
  public void permittedToAllAndAnonymousService() {
    // Permited to all users
  }

  @DenyAll @AnonymousAllowed
  public void deniedService() {
    // Denied to all users
  }

  @RolesAllowed("ROLE_ADMIN") @AnonymousAllowed
  public void permittedToToleService() {
    // Permited to all users
  }
}
----

==== Class-level Examples

[source,java]
----
@VaadinService
@DenyAll
public class MyService {

  public void deniedService() {
    // Denied to all users
  }

  @AnonymousAllowed
  public void anonymousService() {
   // Permited to all users
  }

  @PermitAll
  public void permittedToAllService() {
    // Permited to all authenticated users
  }

  @RolesAllowed("ROLE_ADMIN")
  public void permittedToToleService() {
    // Permited to all authenticated users belonging to the ROLE_ADMIN
  }
}

== [[appendix]]APPENDIX
=== The OAuth 2.0 Specification

https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749[OAuth 2.0 Authorization Framework] is mainly intended for federated login and server-to-server requests, but It can also be used for other purposes.

Based on the authentication process it defines different types, the typical one is the https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-4.1[*_Authorization Code grant_*] that describes the most complex OAuth flow, thouth,  we are interested in the https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-4.3[*_Password grant_*] which is a simplified case of that, and is used in the *_Vaadin Connect Authentication flow_*.

[NOTE]
====
These two types are described in the following sections as a reference, and to avoid confussion. You don't need to implement anything to use Vaadin Connect OAuth.
====

=== _Password Grant_ flow

It is applicable for clients capable of obtaining the user's credentials directly, it means that the user trusts in the `_client application_` which has an interactive form for typing the username and password.

The *_Password Grant flow_* is originated when the `_resource owner_` (aka user) introduces its username and password to the `_client application_`, then the client sends a request with the provided credentials to the `_authorization server_` to get an `_access token_`. Finally the `_authorization server_` validates the credentials, and issues an `_access token_` that the client utilizes to consume `_resource server_` services.

image::password-grant-oauth-flow.png[Password Grant Diagram]

=== _Authorization Code Grant_ flow

It is applicable for more complex scenarios, the typical case is when the the `_resource server_` does not have any authorization system and trusts on 3rd party user-accout databases like Google, Twitter, etc.

The *_Authorization Code Grant flow_* describes how the `_user_` is redirected to the `_authorization server_` in order to, once authenticated, get an  `_authentication code_` that is passed back to the `_client application_` through the user's browser. The `_client application_` uses the `_authentication code_` besides the `_client secret_` to get an `_access token_` from the `_authorization server_` that the `_client_` will use to consume the service from the `_resource server_`.
