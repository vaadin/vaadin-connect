= Vaadin Connect Maven plugin

The Vaadin Connect project provides a helper plugin for generating the frontend resources based on a backend
declaration of every `@VaadinService` annotated Java class.

== Generation steps

Full generation consists of three consequent steps:

* Open Api v3 specification generation

Refer to
https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification[OpenAPI specification]
for more details on the specification considered in this section.

The generation is done based on the the project sources and Vaadin Connect properties file, if present.
Refer to
https://github.com/vaadin/vaadin-connect/blob/master/vaadin-connect/src/main/java/com/vaadin/connect/VaadinConnectProperties.java[`VaadinConnectProperties`]
Java class for more details on the Vaadin Properties.

If the properties file is not present, defaults from the Java file mentioned above are used.

As the generation result, an OpenAPI json file is created, the file can be used to visualize the application api via
https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-ui/[swagger-ui] and the following, modules' generation step is based on this file.

* Default Vaadin Client generation

A default client is generated, using the Vaadin Connect properties for initializing the client for the user instead
of writing the boilerplate for each project.

Same as in the previous step, if no properties file is present, defaults are used.

As the generation result, a JavaScript module created, containing the default vaadin-client declaration.
This module can be used in the frontend part of the project to omit the manual client configuration.

* Vaadin Service JavaScript modules' generation

Requires an OpenAPI json generated on the first step.

As the generation result, JavaScript modules are created for each `@VaadinService` Java class, providing an easy
access to the backend api on the client side.

[NOTE]
====
The generation creates all the necessary files and directories, if they are absent.

It also rewrites the generated files each time it is performed.
====

If you feel interested in the modules' generation details, the process in depth is described in the
<<./javascript-generator#,JavaScript generator page>>.

== Usage in Maven

If you're starting the project from scratch and not sure which steps to use, use all of them:


[source,xml]
----
<plugin>
    <groupId>com.vaadin</groupId>
    <artifactId>vaadin-connect-maven-plugin</artifactId>
    <version>${vaadin.connect.version}</version>
    <executions>
        <execution>
            <!--Steps for generating Vaadin Connect helpers for the application-->
            <id>vaadin-connect-resources</id>
            <goals>
                <goal>generate-openapi-spec</goal>
                <goal>generate-vaadin-client</goal>
                <goal>generate-connect-modules</goal>
            </goals>
        </execution>
    </executions>
</plugin>
----

You can remove any goal any time necessary, if not needed anymore.

Plugin can be customized by adding the `<configuration>` section to into the plugin declaration in the pom.xml

The following parameters with their default values are:

* The target file for the OpenAPI spec to be generated to
[source,xml]
----
<openApiJsonFile>${project.build.directory}/generated-resources/openapi.json</openApiJsonFile>
----

* The target directory for the client and modules JavaScript files generated by the plugin
[source,xml]
----
<generatedFrontendDirectory>${project.basedir}/frontend/src/generated/</generatedFrontendDirectory>
----

* The properties file to read the Vaadin Connect properties from, defaults will be used when no file provided
[source,xml]
----
<applicationProperties>${project.basedir}/src/main/resources/application.properties</applicationProperties>
----


Refer to https://github.com/vaadin/base-starter-connect[Vaadin Connect starter project] for the working project with
the plugin configured.
