 * Annotation to mark the services to be processed by

 * becomes a Spring {@link Component} bean.
 *
 * After the class is annotated and processed, it becomes available as a Vaadin
 * Service. This means that the class name and all its public methods (including
 * the ones inherited from a super classes that are not {@link Object}) can be
 * executed via the post call with the correct parameters sent in a request JSON
 * body. The methods' return values will be returned back as a response to the
 * calls. Refer to {@link VaadinConnectController} for more details.
